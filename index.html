        <h3>Pet Adoption Process</h3>
		<div class="process-text">
			<ol>
				<li>Our rehoming center is open on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday from 1-3pm. Outside these hours, we operate on appointment-only basis for potential adopters.</li>
				<li>Make Plans - If you are hoping to welcome a pet into your life, please plan ahead and ensure that it will fit into your lifestyle long term.</li>
				<li>Pre-Adoption Talk - You can attend our pre-adopting talk online from the comfort and safety of your home. You'll get a chance to ask questions of our team members and find out more about how we can help your new pet settle in.</li>
				<li>First Date - Depending on your new pet's needs, we'll sometimes arrange for you to meet them before they come home and get to know them a little better. You may need to meet them multiple times before they join you home.</li>
				<li>Happy Life - Get advice and support from our team.</li>
